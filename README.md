# JointSavings Smart Contract

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, this solidity smart contract accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Code
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract JointSavings {
    address payable accountOne;
    address payable accountTwo;
    address public lastToWithdraw;
    uint public lastWithdrawAmount;
    uint public contractBalance;

    function withdraw(uint amount, address payable recipient) public {
        require(recipient == accountOne || recipient == accountTwo, "You don't own this account!");
        require(contractBalance > amount, "Insufficient funds!");

        if (lastToWithdraw != recipient) {
            lastToWithdraw = recipient;
        }

        recipient.transfer(amount);
        lastWithdrawAmount = amount;
        contractBalance  = address(this).balance;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        contractBalance = address(this).balance;
    }

    function setAccounts(address payable account1, address payable account2) public{
        accountOne = account1;
        accountTwo = account2;
    }

    function() external payable {}
}
